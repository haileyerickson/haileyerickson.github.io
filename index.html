<p bgcolor="#fff" style="padding: 0px 60px 20px 60px">Hailey here - this is my first post on the blog that I just created! It's amazing how just a few characters in a line of code can turn something completely boring and blank, into something so beautiful. And in just a few minutes! But that sort of describes me in a nut shell, not that I am beautiful, but the geek designer in me who thinks that CODE can create something beautiful. Well, that code can turn my <i>designs</i> into something beautiful! Lets not give all the credit to the code.</p>
<p style="padding: 0px 60px 20px 60px"> Pretty lame, I know. But that's exactly why I decided to create my own web page and blog. Because I am a designer who is so obsessed with having everything around me beautiful that I couldn't stand another minute for my designs to be completely botched by some design-blind developer! Nancy Meyers once said in an interview about why she decided to start directing her own screenplays: <blockquote cite="http://ajpitts.com/news-article/at-the-top-of-her-game-nancy-meyers-delivers-a-hit-for-the-holidays/132/"> "I had been so hands-on during all of our movies; I was there every minute and sitting at the monitor and ironically, I didn’t have a huge desire to do it until I did it. I was raising two kids and writing and producing movies, that’s a lot of jobs, and I didn’t need another one. But at a certain point, producing felt like not enough. That's really why I became a director, honestly it really started out of just protecting the screenplay."</blockquote></p>
