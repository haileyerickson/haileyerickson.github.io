						<p>I grew up in Southeast Boise, down the street from my husband, where I had dreams of being the next great Hans Zimmer writing music for movies. I followed that dream to music school in Boston where I ended up spending more time nannying children than writing Oscar-worthy songs. Long story short - I took one big bite of humble pie and moved home to Boise and enrolled at Boise State. One music professor's judgement later and I was once again taking bites of humble pie to realize that maybe my dream of Tinseltown wasn't where I was meant to be. So I shifted gears to my other love, design and art, and have never looked back!</p>

						<p>Sounds like a big jump from music to design but somehow ... it really wasn't. To me writing music was more of a rhythmic strategy than a neoclassical talent anyways, and knowing that about myself really helped me to see the underlying common denominator I had between music and design in the first place: the ability to dissect, rearrange and put back together something to make it new and better than before. Some people call this composing, some call it craft, I call it styling.</p>

						<p>I love to style an identity through artful storytelling. I love helping brands speak to their audience through interactive interfaces. I love creating thoughtful impressions by designing intentional user experiences.</p>

						<p>I also love

							<br>- creating playlists for every moment in the day
							<br>- slapstick comedies that leave me laughing for days
							<br>- rearranging furniture in my home for the 100th time
							<br>- experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen
							<br>- treasure hunting at a flea market or auction
							<br>- going on long walks with my little family
							<br><br>I believe that happiness is a choice we make everyday, continual improvement fuels the imagination and all human emotions can usually be summed up in hilarious .gifs</p>

I can claim love at first sight for this boy when he walked me home from school one day when we were just 10 years old. I loved him then and I love him now. We've been married 8 years and look forward to at least 58 more together. </p>
